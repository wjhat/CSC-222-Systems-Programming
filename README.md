- Tokenizer Program – Implemented a tokenizer function in C that takes the user input array as a parameter and prints each token.
- WSH Program – Implemented a basic Command Line Interpreter written in C. The program allows the user to enter commands, which are then parsed and executed. The program also supports input/output redirection.
